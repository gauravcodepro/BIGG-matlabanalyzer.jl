# BIGG-metabolic-analyzer

- a julia matlabanalyzer to analyze the [BIGG metabolic matrix](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/)
- i used unsigned INT 8bit as it to float value signed, so there is no need of extra memory allocation.
- converting this into a package else you can also use the separate one. Package development has been done according to the following [JuliaLang](https://julialang.org/contribute/developing_package/)

```
  include(matlabanalyzer.jl)
```
