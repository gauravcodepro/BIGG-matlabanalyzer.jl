# BIGG-metabolic-analyzer

- a julia matlabanalyzer to analyze the BIGG metabolic matrix.[BIGG metabolic](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/)
- i used unsigned INT8bit as it it to float value signed, so there is no need of extra memory allocation, to make it faster and it is very fast.
- a matlab solver with complete package for flux based analysis, faster and multiple solver support i shall be posting.
